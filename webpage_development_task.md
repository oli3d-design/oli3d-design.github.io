Hey, you're a Senior Developer Engineer, who has expertise in frontend and backend development. I need you to help me with a task. The task consists on creating here, a project that I can directly upload to GitHub as a repository, and it will become a Github Pages website, so that I can host it for free. So it should meet the requirements for that.

The website is for my company, Oli3D Design, which is a company specialized in 3D printing and 3D design. We focus mainly on customized objects that are a perfect fit for a gift, but also, we offer 3D printing services for any object you need. The requirements for this webpage are the following:

1. It is in Spanish, and it should have four pages: Inicio, Tienda, Sobre Nosotros, Contacto. I don't know if it is possible in GitHub pages, but I would like it to be independent pages, I mean, not a single page that scrolling you get the different "subpages". So if you click "Inicio", you go only to the "Inicio" page, and if you scroll, you won't see other pages like "Tienda". This requirement only if it is possible in GitHub pages, otherwise, it is not a requirement.

2. Our logo is available in @resources folder. The color palette of the website should be the one used in the logos: gray, light blue, dark blue and intermediate blue.

3. For the development stack, please, choose the most appropriate you consider, while also, the most maintainable and scalable one. It should be simple to modify in the future.

4. In the "Sobre Nosotros" section, for example, you have some ideas in the picture shown in @ONLY_FOR_REFERENCE_DO_NOT_COPY\oli3d\about_us.png , but do not copy it exactly, it is only for reference. It should not be too much text, it should be something more attractive for a potential customer. Try your best. Just information about us: we are four friends who have been involved in 3D printing for more than 10 years, and now we decided to start our own company to offer 3D printing services for any object you need. 

5. In the "Inicio" page, I would like to have something really visual, pre-catching, that for example, show highlighted products (we will have a database of products and we will tag them with highlighted true/false), also, show a section of latest products, most popular categories (also the categories we will define each product to which category belong to, and we will say which category are popular). As reference, you can use the image shown in @ONLY_FOR_REFERENCE_DO_NOT_COPY\oli3d\home.png but do not copy it exactly, it is only for reference.

6. About how to manage products will be using a database, but as it will be hosted in GitHub pages for now, what can we use? I think a folder called "db" with JSONs inside is a good fit? As it should be easy to modify. There should be a db for products, and other for categories. Each product should have the following attributes: name, description, price (it can include some sales per quantity, so multiple prices can be shown, like a big one per unit, and then smaller ones per quantity offer), image (path to the image), highlighted (true/false), categories (id of the categories as could be one or more), link to the wallapop's page of the product (optional), size of the object, material (PLA almost always). It is important that, we're not going for now, to offer an option to buy directly in the webpage, instead the user will have max two options: wallapop's link (sometimes) and always a button to ask for price that basically, will send us an e-mail with the product name, quantity, and the user's description about what they want, as they can be customized. The second db is about categories, as we would like to have some categories to organize our products. These categories are: Keychains, Sports, Celebrations, Christmas (temporal), Halloween (temporal), Pets, Babies, Office, Home, and for now, I don't know more... But as you can see, they're quite heterogeneous, so please, try to make it in a way that it doesn't seem too difficult for a customer to navigate and understand where we will find it. Also, an option is "All" to show all objects. 

7. Of course, the webpage should be focused to be intuitive and easy to navigate, so please, try to make it in a way that it doesn't seem too difficult for a customer to navigate and understand where we will find it. Prioritize as much User Experience, that is the most important thing, while also, try to be quite visual in general, and avoid too much text.

8. For now, some of our products are in @products folder, so you can use them to start using them as an example. Categorize as you consider based on their names.

9. The "Tienda" page should allow the user to select a certain category, so to filter out only these products. Additionally, should allow to order by price (ascending and descending), also by name, etc. Remember, we're not selling directly here, so we can not order by relevance, as we have no idea of the relevance here. The products should be paginated. As a reference, you can get use the picture in @ONLY_FOR_REFERENCE_DO_NOT_COPY\oli3d\shop.png
